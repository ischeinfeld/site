Hi! My name is Isaac and I am a junior in college studying math and [symbolic systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/ssp_description). I enjoy learning about many different things, some of which you may find here on my website. Mostly, I love studying the beauty that mathematical structures bring to nature and technology.

Many of my interests involve mathematics and programming, and at this point they are common to all of the content here. But perhaps one day I will post the short story I've been thinking about since 2015?

Also, [here is my resume](https://github.com/ischeinfeld/cv/blob/master/cv.pdf), if that's what you were looking for.
